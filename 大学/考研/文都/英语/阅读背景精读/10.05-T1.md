　　Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as 'all too human', with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.
　　The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. he, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of "goods and services" than males.
　　Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan's and Dr. de Waal's study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.
　　In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods （and much preferable to cucumbers）. So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber （without an actual monkey to eat it）was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
　　The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

1. ①每一个人喜欢一个丰富的薪水。②然而，如果你认识到同事有更多的薪水，你有的乐趣能消失。③真正地，如果他有一个懒惰的名誉，你可能会被激怒。④伴随着基础的假设其他的动物不能很好的发展出不满的感觉 ，这种行为被认为是“太人类”。⑤但是一项被发表在自然杂志上来自佐治亚州亚特兰大埃默里大学的莎拉·布鲁斯南和弗朗斯·德瓦尔的研究建议这一切都太猴子了。
2. ①研究员们学习了母棕卷尾猴的行为。②它们看起来很可爱③他们是一种和蔼，协作的动物，它们还很乐意去分享他们的食物④首先，和女人的作用一样，它们比雄性倾向于更密切的关注商品和服务的价值
3. ①这种特点使他们成为布鲁斯南和瓦尔博士的研究完美的候选人②研究者们花了两年时间教他们的猴子去用代币换食物③通常的，这些猴子很开心用岩石块交换黄瓜片④然而，当两只猴子分开放担靠近房间的时候，因此每一个都能观察到另一个从它岩石块得到的，他们的行为变得显著的不一样
4. ①在卷尾猴的世界里，葡萄是奢侈的货物（比黄瓜更好）②所以当一个猴子交换得到的是葡萄，第二个勉强去递出他的手换仅仅一块黄瓜③然后如果一个完全不需要提供它的代币交换收到一个葡萄，其他的猴子要么把他的代币投掷在研究者或者投掷出房间外或者拒绝接受黄瓜块。④甚至，在其他房间仅仅存在的一个葡萄（没有一个真正地猴子去吃它）就足以在雌性卷尾猴中引起怨恨
5. ①研究者们认为卷尾猴们像人类一样能被社会情绪引导②在野外，他们是合作的，群居的动物③这种合作很可能是保持稳定只有当每一个动物感觉到他没被欺骗④就像正直愤慨的感觉不能保护单独的人们⑤对组织其他成员来说完全拒绝一个更少的奖励使得这些感觉十分清楚⑥然而，在人类和卷尾猴中这个公平的感觉是否形成了 或者 它是否起源于相同的3500万年久祖先，迄今为止任然是一个未知的问题
